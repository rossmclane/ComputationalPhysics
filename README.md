This is a simulation of a "wave pendulum." A wave pendulum refers to a number of pendulums with monotonically varying lengths, such that each pendulum executes one less full cycle than the pendulum next to it in some fixed amount of time. The result is a hypnotic pattern that arises and disintegrates into seeming chaos only to reappear at the end of its cycle.

This simulation is implemented using a Jupyter Notebook.
